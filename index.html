<p>Welcome to the Simply Basic abode, where comfort food comes first! A few of my favorite pasta recipes from some of my favorite food bloggers and recipe books! If you enjoy cozy nights with close friends + family and a whole lot of pasta, you're in the right spot! I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as I do making them. <img src="closeup.jpg" alt="closeup" width="400" height="600" align="right"<figure></p>
<p>I've always enjoyed cooking. Not so much baking, as I found myself leaving cookies in the oven for too long... I leave the baking to my brother who makes the yummiest and softet chocolate chip cookies I've ever had! For me, my inspiration for Simply Basic comes from my mother's cook book she has made over the years of passed down recipes. Since we have entered a digital world that doesn't seem to be slowing down, I thought I'd add create this page that is easily accessible, changable, and allows for sharing! I only hope to add more in the next coming months.</p>
