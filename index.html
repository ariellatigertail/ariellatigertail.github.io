    <h1>Ariella Tigertail</h1>

    <p>Fun fact: A dream trip of mine is to visit Africa and photograph the wildlife. It's safe to say giraffe's are my favorite ainmal, for obvious reasons! How beauitful is it that these creatures were created so beautifully and full of color. Then I'd like to travel up to Morroco and immerse myself in the culture and textiles. I'm a sucker for colorful rugs, bags and handmade bracelets. There are far too many beautiful places to visit in our little world!!  </p>
