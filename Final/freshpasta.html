<h3>Cook's Notes</h3>
<p>Every chef should know how to make pasta. This is a basic recipe that takes practice, time, and patience to perfect. Do not skip the kneading or resting portion of the recipe, they are essential for light pasta.</p>


<h3>Fresh Pasta</h3>
<h3>Serves 3-4</h3>
<h3>Difficulty:Moderate</h3>
<h3>Cook Time: 30 min</h3>
<h3>Total Time: 1 hour</h3>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<p>3 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour or 1 3/4 cup all-purpose flour and 1 3/4 cup semolina flour, mixed</p>
<p>4 extra large eggs</p>

<h3>METHOD</h3>
<p>Mound the flour in the center of a large wooden cutting board. Make a well in the flour for the eggs. Add eggs to well.</p>
<p>Using a fork, beat together in the eggs and begin to incorporate the flour starting with the inner rim of the well. As you incorporate the eggs, keep pushing the flour up to retain the well shape (do not worry if it looks messy). The dough will come together in a shaggy mess when about half of the flour is incorporated.</p>
<p>Start kneading the dough with both hands, primarily using the palms of your hands. Add more flour, in 1/2 cup increments, if the dough is too sticky. Once the dough is a cohesive mass, remove dough from the board and scrape up any leftover dry bits.</p>
<p>Lightly flour the boad and continue kneading for 3 more minutes. The dough shoudl be elastic and a little sticky. Continue to knead for another 3 minutes, remembering to dust the board with flour when necessary. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and set aside for 20-30 minutes at room temperature.</p>
<p>Unwrap dough and using a rolling pin, roll to desired thickness. Dough can be divided into equal balls for easier rolling, or rolled into one large sheet. For linguini, roll out a thin, flat sheet, then roll into a spiral, like cinnamon rolls. Starting at one end, cut pasta to the desired width. Separate newly formed noodles carefully with hands. Dust with semolina flour to prevent sticking.</p>
