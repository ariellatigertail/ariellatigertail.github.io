<h3>Mushroom Filling</h3>
<h3>Serves 3-4</h3>
<h3>Difficulty: Moderate</h3>
<h3>Cook Time: 20 min</h3>
<h3>Total Time: 30 hour</h3>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<p>2/3 pound skiitake mushroom (302 grams)</p>
<p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>Kosher salt</p>
<p>1/4 cup Mushroom brodo</p>
<h3>METHOD</h3>
<p>To make mushroom filling, first clean the mushrooms. Remove mushroom stems if they are too stiff for use. Tear them in half and wash the pieces thoroughly in a large bowl of water. Lift the mushrooms out of the water and drain in a colander. Blot gently with paper towels to remove excess moiusture.</p>
<p>Heat a 12-inch saute pan over high heat and add the olive oil. Once the oil is almost smoking, add the mushrooms. Cook until evaporated and the pan is dry, about 5 minutes. Season with salt. You should have about 1 1/2 cups cooked mushrooms.</p>
<p>Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooked mushrooms and set them aside in an airtight container in the fridge.</p>
<p>Combine 1 cup of the cooked mushrooms and the 1/4 cup of the brodo in a food processor and the puree until almost smooth. Adjust the seasoning with salt. Reserve in an airtight container in the fridge.</p>
