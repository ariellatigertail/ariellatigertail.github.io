<p>Again, comfort food over everything! I know I know, how do I enjoy such spicy pastas when I live in Miami, FL where it's high temperatures all year around. BUT! If we're lucky, we get a few days of cooler temperatures. So, during one of those cooler nights I make my way to the grocery store and stock up on these exact ingredients paired with a white wine. There is something cozy about warm pasta with a little spice to it. I stumbled across this delicious recipe on <a href="https://juliasalbum.com/tomato-spinach-chicken-spaghetti/">Julia's Album</a>. I'm vegetarian and this dish can easily be made without any chicken, that's why its my go to staple when my family is hungry for pasta! Did I mention everything is fresh and it makes it that much better. Time to carb load folks! Winter is here... For some of us... I hope you enjoy this recipe and check out Julia's Album for more delicious plates of goodness! <img src="me.jpg" alt="Me" width="400" height="400" align="right"<figure></p>
